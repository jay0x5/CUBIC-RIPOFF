A basic script to allow you to chroot inside any stock ubunut ISO instead of doing the samething manually or installing CUBIC software
wrote this script just as a hobby


**How to Use:**

**Step1**:Create a folder with desired name

**Step2**:Then put your ubuntu iso image inside the folder, make sure not to edit its name and keep it default

**Step3**: Download or clone this repository

**Step4**:Now for the final step, put the configure.py and write.py inside that folder and run the configure.py and follow the prompts

**Step5**: Once you are done with the configure.py script, you can enter the chroot environment with "sudo chroot . bash"

**Step6**: After you are done configuring the filesystem, exit and run mksq.py to squash the filesystem again and put it inside the appropriate folder

**Step7**: Now for the final step copy all the extracted files to a pendrive or any bootable device and boot in your custom configured ubuntu os :D



**If you have any issues with the script, you may bring that up as an Issue here on github or contact me at => contactjay0x5@gmail.com**
